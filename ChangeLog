http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/pedstats/

This version incorporates the following minor bug fixes:

   * Fix to test for a significance difference in the 
     effect of maternally and paternally inherited alleles,
     when used in conjunction with the total association test.

   * Prelude handling of markers that have only 1 allele,
     when generating Simwalk2 files.

   * Enhancements to core libraries speed up handling of 
     very large pedigree files.
